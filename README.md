# Writer
A simple javascript clone of the android app Writer

## In action
[Click here to view the demo](https://flawiddsouza.github.io/Writer/)

As it uses your browser's localStorage, nothing will be saved on the server. All your notes are saved locally on your computer.

## Usage
- Clone or Download ZIP
- Open index.html in your favorite browser and you're good to go :)
- If you don't want to clone or download anything, you can just use the demo page forever!

## Notes
- If you change the location of Writer's directory, then all your notes will be lost
- But they can be got back by recreating the older path
- It's always better to host it on a server or locally, so that your url never changes

## Known Issues
- It sometimes doesn't play nice with Firefox, so it's recommended to use Chrome.
